						<h3>Celina Wan</h3>
						<p>Celina is a mining engineering student with a B.Sc. in Biology and mathematics. She spends her summer weekends skydiving and enjoys packing parachutes. In class, she fantasizes on flying instead of listening to her lecture. When she is not skydiving, she enjoys cooking, going to the gym and attempts to make her pole dance moves look good but looks more like a clumsy panda sliding down its bamboo.</p>

						<h3>Justin Berube</h3>
						<p>Justin was the fourth co-president along with Alex Farnsworth. He started his aviation ambitions with the Royal Canadian Air Cadets, flying since he was 16 y.o., and obtained his Private Pilot License (PPL) at 17. He taught the theory of flight at his local squadron until he aged out, and occasionally flew at the SaintJeansurRichelieu airport. When on the ground, Justin is active in Canadian politics, travels, and is involved with local and student life. Interesting Fact: Justin also plays the Great Highland Bagpipes (wears the kilt too!).</p>
