						<p>Alex is currently managing Pilot for a Day events. Previously, he served as the fourth co-president along with Justin Berube. Alex studied electrical engineering at McGill. He grew up in the Kootenays of British Columbia where the mountains are what turned his head towards the sky. He has his Private Pilot's license as well as Glider instructors rating. When he’s not doing DPM or trying to figure out C++, you can find him scouting out the latest allyoucanfinish sushi restaurant. Interesting Fact: Every summer Alex has taught 15-17 year olds how to fly, they all have their license!</p>

						<h3>Ali Najmaldin - <i><span style="font-weight: normal;">External</span></i></h3>
						<p>Ali is a third-year student at McGill and is studying Bioengineering unfortunately. He is so passionate about
							aviation
							that he decided to go for his commercial pilot license. When he’s not flying around Montreal, you will
							usually find him
							behind a computer screen coding and solving geeky math problems. If that wasn’t enough of a headache on its
							own, Ali is
							also a teaching assistant for the Department of Mathematics & Statistics so that he can be submerged in new
							diverse
							complex problems every day all while helping others; the unknown is what gets him up in the morning. He also
							aspires to
							be a surgeon one day. So many dreams! As he used to say, “life is either a daring adventure or nothing at
							all”.</p>
