                <h2>Sponsarships</h2>
                <p>Dear partner,
                Thank you for your interest in becoming a supporter of the McGill Students Flying Club (MSFC). The MSFC has become one
                of Canada’s largest student-run aviation organizations. Operating from McGill University in Montreal, the MSFC provides
                a platform for its members to engage in flight training and other aviation-related activities.
                Our members move on to impressive careers in a wide range of fields across the globe. Sponsoring our club will allow you
                to connect with these individuals and make a lasting impression as they go out into industry. Our subscriber list alone
                includes over 1000 aviation enthusiasts and over the course of the year we come face-to-face with thousands of McGill
                students in different domains who are fascinated by our mission.
                Whether your goal is to promote your business, increase your exposure to potential customers, engage more with youth,
                recruit potential employees and/or to foster goodwill with consumers, we can help you to achieve this.
                    <!-- and offers AFF/PFF courses leading to the Solo License, as well as other competency certifications.-->

                <!--<p>As per its new mandate this year, the division is tasked with forming its own Parachute Team by the end of Fall 2016. Toward that end, there will be a recruitment process for individuals interested in completing their Accelerated/Progressive Free-Fall (AFF/PFF) course and earning their Solo Certificate and progress to A and B licenses to jump in a group.</p>-->

                    The skydiving Division is dedicated to making it easier for McGill students to satisfy their inner
                    thrill seeker, whether for the first or tenth time. The team helps set up transportation, group
                    discounts and general logistics to both outdoor and indoor skydiving locations. Check out <a
