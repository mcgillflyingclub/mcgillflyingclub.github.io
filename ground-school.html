				<h2>Ground School (GS) Division</h2>
				<p>The GS Division is tasked with organizing and running Ground School courses for a particular license. It has organized the Private Pilot License (PPL) Ground School on campus since 2012 and has expanded since then to plan ground schools for other license types. In 2015, for the first time, Ground School courses were opened for registration to the public, in addition to the McGill community, in an effort to make aviation education more accessible to the Montreal community.</p>

				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>Ground School is the theoretical/classroom component of your flight training. It is called “ground school” since the other component is the practical or actual flying which takes place in the sky. In order to get a particular pilot license, you need to successfully complete both the theoretical and practical components to earn your license. In a way, it’s similar to getting your driver’s license where you have to pass a written test and then the actual driving test to earn your license, except in this case, the training is much more involved. A Private Pilot License or PPL, will allow you to fly a single-engine prop plane, like a cessna 172, anywhere, with passengers, only during daylight in VFR conditions.</p>
				<h3>Ground School at McGill</h3>
				<p> <span class="image left"><img src="images/top-gun-charlie.JPG" alt="" /></span> There are a lot of reasons why Ground School offered by the McGill Students' Flying Club is special. Primarily, it is the convenience of doing a Ground School course on campus and in downtown. It saves the time and cost of having to commute back to your flight school just to take the Ground School classes. We make the flight school come to you! So, you only have to go to the flight school for your actual flying. We also offer the courses at a discount of 30-50% of the actual costs while you have access to the best instructors that we carefully select for you. Not to mention that you get access to an entire community of McGill and Montreal pilots to network with and help you through your learning experience.</p>
				<h3>Available Courses</h3>
				<p>Currently, the GS Division offers Ground School courses for the Private Pilot License (PPL). If we get enough students interested in any Transport Canada license, we have the resources and friends to make it happen on McGill campus!</p>
