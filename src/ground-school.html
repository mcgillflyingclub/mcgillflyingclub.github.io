          <h2>Ground School (GS) Division</h2>
          <p>
            The GS Division is tasked with organizing and running ground school
            courses. It has organized Private Pilot's License ground school courses on and off 
            campus since 2012, and has recently expanded to provide ground school 
            courses for other license types. In 2015, for the first time, ground 
            school courses were opened to the public for registration. Today, we 
            partner with Harv's Air to provide discounted training courses to all pilots.

          <h3>The Ground School</h3>
          <p>
            Ground School is the theoretical/classroom component of your flight
            training. It is called “ground school” since the other component is
            the actual flying which takes place in the sky. In
            order to get a particular pilot license, you need to successfully
            complete both the theoretical and practical components to earn your
            license. In a way, it’s similar to getting your driver’s license
            where you have to pass a written test and the practical
            test to earn your license.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your very first ground school will likely be for a Private Pilot's License 
            (PPL). Included in the course are the preparatory and practice materials 
            for your Student Pilot Permit, Aviation Regulation Examination (PSTAR) and 
            for your Private Pilot's License - Aeroplane (PPAER). You will also receive 
            instructional material for your air exercises (the actual flying part) for free 
            as part of the course. Once you have completed the preparatory materials to the 
            required standard, you will receive a recommendation to take the written exams. 
            The PSTAR is often done at your flight school. For the subsequent exams that often 
            require specific appointments, feel free to contact our Flight Training (FT) 
            Division for more information on exam sites.
          </p>

          <h3>Ground School at McGill Students' Flying Club</h3>
          <p>
            <span class="image left"
              ><img src="../images/top-gun-charlie.JPG" alt=""
            /></span>
            Ground school at McGill offers a cost-effective solution for delivering 
            the elaborate theoretical materials in a flexible time format. Cost is 
            often a prohibiting factor for young aspiring pilots, and our partnership 
            with Harv's Air allows you to reach your goals at a lower cost. The industry-leading 
            ground school experience offered by Harv's Air provides you a smooth experience in 
            preparing for your exams. Those who have passed through their virtual ground school, 
            including many of our current and former executives, have found much success in the 
            actual written exams administered by Transport Canada. For more information, feel 
            free to contact us using the sidebar or the CONTACT tab.

              ><img src="../images/pfd.PNG" alt=""
            /></span>
            <li>Courses are self-paced with a 270-day access across multiple devices including PC, tablet, and mobile 
              devices.</li>
            <li>
              Each course includes multiple components, covering both materials 
              for the written exam and pre-lesson videos for the air exercises 
              done in actual airplanes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each course ends with a certificate for the completion of ground school 
              courses and a letter of recommend from the supervising instructor when applicable.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the 270 days elapse before your ground school course is finished, your progress 
              is saved, and you may return to the course at anytime using a course renewal offered 
              at a lower price.
