          <h2>Ground School (GS) Division</h2>
          <p>
            The GS Division is tasked with organizing and running Ground School
            courses for a particular license. It has organized the Private Pilot
            License (PPL) Ground School on campus since 2012 and has expanded
            since then to plan ground schools for other license types. In 2015,
            for the first time, Ground School courses were opened for
            registration to the public, in addition to the McGill community, in
            an effort to make aviation education more accessible to the Montreal
            community.

          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>
            Ground School is the theoretical/classroom component of your flight
            training. It is called “ground school” since the other component is
            the practical or actual flying which takes place in the sky. In
            order to get a particular pilot license, you need to successfully
            complete both the theoretical and practical components to earn your
            license. In a way, it’s similar to getting your driver’s license
            where you have to pass a written test and then the actual driving
            test to earn your license, except in this case, the training is much
            more involved. A Private Pilot License or PPL, will allow you to fly
            a single-engine prop plane, like a cessna 172, anywhere, with
            passengers, only during daylight in VFR conditions.
          </p>

          <h3>Ground School at McGill</h3>
          <p>
            <span class="image left"
              ><img src="../images/top-gun-charlie.JPG" alt=""
            /></span>
            There are a lot of reasons why Ground School offered by the McGill
            Students' Flying Club is special. Primarily, it is the convenience
            of doing a Ground School course on campus and in downtown. It saves
            the time and cost of having to commute back to your flight school
            just to take the Ground School classes. We make the flight school
            come to you! So, you only have to go to the flight school for your
            actual flying. We also offer the courses at a discount of 30-50% of
            the actual costs while you have access to the best instructors that
            we carefully select for you. Not to mention that you get access to
            an entire community of McGill and Montreal pilots to network with
            and help you through your learning experience.
          </p>

          <h3>Available Courses</h3>
          <p>
            Currently, the GS Division offers Ground School courses for the
            Private Pilot License (PPL). If we get enough students interested in
            any Transport Canada license, we have the resources and friends to
            make it happen on McGill campus!
