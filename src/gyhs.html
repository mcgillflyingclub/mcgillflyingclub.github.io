              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>
                The Cessna 152 was crafted by Cessna in 1977 as an improved version of 
                the Cessna 150 with the more powerful 110hp Lycoming O-235 engine. The 
                later A152 Aerobat was certified as a positive-g aerobatic aircraft 
                capable of up to +6g. Originally designed to be a two-seat touring 
                aircraft, it has since proven itself to be a cost-effective and 
                robust trainer still in use three decades after the production line 
                was shutdown. At CPAQ, GYHS is the platform of choice for everyone 
                from students working towards their first solo to experienced instructors 
                with thousands of flight hours.

              <h3>Instruments</h3>
              <p>
                GYHS has the standard "six pack" instrumentation found in most training 
                aircrafts. This instrument layout allows students to develop a good 
                scanning pattern early in their training, making the transition to a 
                technologically advanced aircraft simpler than the reverse process. For 
                students in intial training, the instrument layout corresponds to the 
                most number of textbook materials, making the learning process straightforward. 
                For students demonstrating their instructing abilities to an examiner, GYHS 
                allows the easiest breakdown of each instrumentation and their functions.

              <h3>Avionics</h3>
              <p>
                GYHS is equipped with an integrated GPS/COMM unit, a second NAV/COMM 
                unit, a Mode C transponder, and an Artex 406MHz automatic fixed ELT 
                unit. The Bendix King KLX 135A is one of the original GPS units to ever 
                be introduced into general aviation. Despite its age, the unti still 
                displays a moving map, airport, navaids, and all esssential features of 
                a VFR GPS. The slightly younger KX 155A comm 2 unit features a standard 
                comm channel with 25k spacing, and a standard NAV channel with VOR capabilities. 
                The Narco AT 150 Mode C transponder fulfills the requirements for all Canadian 
                controlled airspace, and the big IDENT button is effortless to locate by day 
                or by night. Below the transponder is the remote unit for the Artex ELT located 
                in the tail of the aircraft. The Artex unit transmits on both 121.5 and 406MHz, 
                conforming to all modern safety standards.

              <h3>Electrical System</h3>
              <p>
                On the flight test, the examiner may ask the candidate to describe 
                the electrical system of the aircraft. With GYHS, you won't have too 
                much to study. With switches few enough to literally count on one 
                hand, the 152 allows you to understand the airplane in a reasonable 
                amount of time.

              <h3>Ancillary Controls</h3>
              <p>
                With a simple fixed-pitch propeller, the ancillary controls of GYHS 
                is simplicity itself. With the gated selector flaps handle, the system 
                is set-and-forget. The trim wheel and carburetor heat controls located 
                conveniently beside the throttle, it's a simple and intuitive array of 
                controls to manage on go-arounds and landings.

              <h3>The View</h3>
              <p>
                With the instrument layout, the view forward from the pilot's seat is 
                faily unobstructed. The narrow instrument panel ensures that every 
                control is within easy reach, and no instrument is ever far from your 
                vision. In its normal position, the view over the nose is very good, 
                making maneuvering on the ground effortless.

              <h3>The Cabin</h3>
              <p>
                A salesperson at Cessna will confidently tell you that the Cessna 152 
                is designed for two people. In practice, especially in winter, you may 
                find that claim somewhat... optimistic. The narrow cabin offers enough 
                comfort for two adults, but the disadvantage to easy-to-reach controls 
                is that you will certainly be very... familiar... with your co-occupant. 
                Unlike most flight school 152s, GYHS contains a set of brand-new upholstry 
                that is well cared for through the years.

              <h3>Control Systems</h3>
              <p>
                An old design has its merits. Most of the control surfaces of the Cessna 
                152 are in the style pictured above (rudder control linkage). This makes 
                your daily preflight a breeze, especially in winter where digging around 
                the gaps between the control surfaces is particularly difficult with 
                thick gloves on. Plus, when your flight examiner points to a control for 
                you to explain, it is effortless to point out the connection and method 
                of interaction between a control arm and the corresponding control surface.

              <h3>Hydraulic Systems</h3>
              <p>
                Like most basic training aircrafts, the one hydraulic system on the aircraft 
                is the brake system. Unlikely a car, each main wheel has its independent 
                brake system. Known as "differential brakes", each main wheel brake is activated 
                by tilting the corresponding rudder pedal forward. This enables the airplane 
                to turn using its nosewheel as well as pivoting around the wheel being braked.

              <h3>Pitot Systems</h3>
              <p>
                The wing hosts most of the openings on the Cessna 152. The most prominent 
                feature is the pitot tube. In GYHS, the heating system is still in working 
                order as well. Further out along the wing is the opening for the stall warning 
                horn, operated by the low pressure over the wing sucking air out through the 
                hole. Tucked behind the wing strut is the fuel vent. Air enters the fuel tank 
                through the vent to replace the fuel with air as fuel is burnt.

              <h3>Fuel System</h3>
              <p>
                Between two wing tanks holding 13 US gallons of fuel each, GYHS has a useful 
                flight time of over 2 hours. Despite its slight deficiency in pure speed, it 
                is still more than quick enough to comfortably navigate to nearby airports in 
                the training area. Since the fuel tanks are in the wings above the engine, 
                there is no need to have the mechanical complexity of a fuel pump, nor do you 
                have to worry about your fuel pressure. The single ON-OFF fuel selector is very 
                simple to operate.

              <h3>Engine</h3>
              <p>
                Equipped with the Lycoming O-235 four cylinder, horizontally opposed, air-cooled, 
                110bhp piston engine, the Cessna 152 will not win any climb rate competition. Taking 
                off at maximum takeoff weight, you will find that the best-rate-of-climb speed is 
                very much a necessity. On the flip side, the small engine is incredibly efficient, 
                significantly helping the 152 in being economical to operate.
