                Celina is a mining engineering student with a B.Sc. in Biology
                and mathematics. She spends her summer weekends skydiving and
                enjoys packing parachutes. In class, she fantasizes on flying
                instead of listening to her lecture. When she is not skydiving,
                she enjoys cooking, going to the gym and attempts to make her
                pole dance moves look good but looks more like a clumsy panda
                sliding down its bamboo.

                Justin was the fourth co-president along with Alex Farnsworth.
                He started his aviation ambitions with the Royal Canadian Air
                Cadets, flying since he was 16 y.o., and obtained his Private
                Pilot License (PPL) at 17. He taught the theory of flight at his
                local squadron until he aged out, and occasionally flew at the
                SaintJeansurRichelieu airport. When on the ground, Justin is
                active in Canadian politics, travels, and is involved with local
                and student life. Interesting Fact: Justin also plays the Great
                Highland Bagpipes (wears the kilt too!).

              <p>
                Théo was VP Finance at MSFC. He is a second year Management
                student studying Marketing and Information Systems. He was born
                in Paris, France but moved at the age of 8 to Atlanta, GA. After
                spending his middle and high school years in the USA, he chose
                to attend McGill University. His passion for aviation has stuck
                with him throughout his entire life, and after discovering that
                McGill had a Flying Club, he directly applied for an exec
                position, as well as PPL classes. He currently is doing a three
                year internship at Delta Airlines, and hopes to one day work
                within this fascinating aviation industry. Other than his
                passion for aviation, Théo is an avid skier as well as being a
                drummer for the last 10 years.

                Alex studied electrical engineering at McGill. He grew up in the
                Kootenays of British Columbia where the mountains are what
                turned his head towards the sky. He has his Private Pilot's
                license as well as Glider instructors rating. When he’s not
                doing DPM or trying to figure out C++, you can find him scouting
                out the latest allyoucanfinish sushi restaurant. Interesting
                Fact: Every summer Alex has taught 15-17 year olds how to fly,
                they all have their license!
