        <h3>Club History</h3>
        <p>
          This predecessor of McGill Students' Flying Club (MSFC) was the Flying and 
          Navigation Club. Founded in the 1950s, it revolved around prospective 
          navigators sharing and practicing various navigational techniques. 
          The VP Clubs of EUS, Harold Day, envisioned the idea of a flying club 
          after discovering the 1950s records, and the MSFC was re-founded at the 
          McGill Engineering Undergraduate Society (EUS) in March of 2012 by Farzan 
          Subhani, Guy Haddad, Joe Hayek, Kari Rosteck, Sebastien Mezeret, and Salman 
          Hashmi (listed in alphabetical order). Since the club's revival, our 
          Co-Presidents Lauren Nagel, Ali Najmaldin, and Madison Santos have seen the 
          Club through the expansion of partnerships and the challenges of COVID-19 to 
          the present the club as you see it today.

              <p>
                Ali is a third-year student at McGill and is studying
                Bioengineering unfortunately. He is so passionate about aviation
                that he decided to go for his commercial pilot license. When
                he’s not flying around Montreal, you will usually find him
                behind a computer screen coding and solving geeky math problems.
                If that wasn’t enough of a headache on its own, Ali is also a
                teaching assistant for the Department of Mathematics &
                Statistics so that he can be submerged in new diverse complex
                problems every day all while helping others; the unknown is what
                gets him up in the morning. He also aspires to be a surgeon one
                day. So many dreams! As he used to say, “life is either a daring
                adventure or nothing at all.”
