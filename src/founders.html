        <h2>Founders</h2>
        <p>
          The McGill Students' Flying Club was founded at the McGill Engineering
          Undergraduate Society (EUS) in March of 2012 by (in alphabetical
          order): Farzan Subhani, Guy Haddad, Joe Hayek, Kari Rosteck, Sebastien
          Mezeret, and Salman Hashmi. Then EUS VP Clubs, Harold Day, came up
          with the idea of a flying club after discovering records of a club
          that existed at McGill in the 1950s. This predecessor of MSFC, The
          Flying and Navigation Club, particularly revolved around prospective
          navigators sharing and practicing various navigational techniques.
