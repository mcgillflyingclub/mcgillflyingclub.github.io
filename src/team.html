            <h3>Michael Zhou</h3>
            <p>
              Michael is a pilot and one of the VP Events of the club. He is in his first year of Mechanical Engineering and 
              is planning to get a minor in aerospace. Since a young age he has fallen prey to the charms of mother nature – 
              both its breathtaking landscape and the mind-blowing scientific laws that shape the world; no magic brings them 
              together better than aviation. He started flying in the Prairies, receiving his PPL on the flatlands of 
              Saskatchewan. Fascinated by the theory of flight, he has decided that one day he will design his own big jets. 
              Outside of school, he is a big fan of natural documentaries, video games, association football, and math.

            <h3>Sean Fernandes</h3>
            <p>
              Born and raised in Dubai, Sean fell in love with aviation through his experience growing up with 
              Microsoft Flight Simulator and flying often with Emirates. Eventually, Sean moved to England to 
              pursue a degree in Marketing, and his passion for aviation was highlighted when he worked on a 
              British Airways project to safely bring back customers during the uncertainty of the pandemic. He 
              decided to move to Canada and joined McGill to pursue Applied Marketing. Sean joined the MSFC to 
              help spread the word among McGill students, organize events, and bring more people into the amazing 
              world of aviation!

            <h3>Estelle Huy</h3>
            <p>
              Estelle is a U1 Mechanical Engineering Student. After completing her first commercial flight at age 
              six when her family moved to Canada from France, she was terrified at the idea of doing it again. 
              But with enough back and forth, fear turned passion and she passed her PPL before heading to McGill. 
              Perhaps to mock her previous fear, she now hopes to get into aerobatics. Aside from her studies and 
              passion for aviation, she can be found editing photos or on outside ventures.

              Valentine is a U1 Mechanical engineering student from Strasbourg, France. She passed her private pilot 
              license during high school at the age of 17 years old. With a passion for aviation and aerospace, she 
              dreams of one day working in these exciting fields. When she’s not flying or studying, you’ll find her 
              recording episodes of her Le Trio podcast with her twin sister and brother, outside playing some kind 
              of sport, or designing and manufacturing a formula one car with the McGill Formula Electric club.

              Brigit is a U1 Mechanical Engineering student from Ottawa, Ontario. She has no flight experience,
              but is training with the Canadian Armed Forces; when she finishes her degree at McGill, 
              she will begin courses to become a pilot for the Royal Canadian Air Force.
              She first got interested in aviation by reading about astronauts who train in planes for spaceflight.
              In her free time, you’ll find her playing the violin, reading books, and traveling.

              where he obtained his Private Pilot License. You'll find him exploring new ventures all the time, whether it's philosophy, 
              entrepreneurship, or simply enjoying life with friends! He hopes to get into aerobatics and do some crazy stuff

            <p>
              Haoning is a U3 biology student in the middle of his instructor’s rating. What started out as a hobby 
              rapidly turned into a second career about midway through his private pilot’s license. Since then, he 
              has progressed along the traditional “pilot pipeline” collecting his commercial pilot’s license, group 
              3 instrument rating, and multi-engine rating. As the most experienced MSFC member, he aims to harness 
              the potential offered by this year’s fresh and incredibly diverse team to reinvigorate the MSFC, and 
              ensure that it continues to flourish in its second decade.

               Aviation was always an irreplaceable part of her life, and she hopes to take part in organising exciting 
               events for fellow aviation lovers this year! Besides aviation, her passions are travelling, playing the 
               violin, listening to jazz, and musical theatre.

            <h3>Lutming Wong</h3>
            <p>
              Lutming is a U1 student in computer engineering. He has been playing flight simulator since the age of 10, 
              and has had almost a decade of flight simulator experience. What inspired Lutming into flying was his father, 
              who works as an air traffic controller. He was brought to the airport and into the tower quite often to spot 
              planes when he was a little kid. Lutming hopes to start getting his pilot’s license in the not so far future; 
              aviation is his dream, and nothing can stop him from pursuing that dream.

            <h3>Elio</h3>
            <p>
              Elio is a U2 Mechanical Engineering student planning to minor in aerospace. Fascinated by the aviation world from a young age,
              he started his passion by visiting cockpits, going plane spotting, and gathering hundreds of hours on flight simulators. 
              He enrolled in an internship at his local aeroclub, where he got to fly his first Cessna, and he's been planning on getting his PPL ever since. 
              During his free time, you will find him flying on VATSIM, a flight simulator server where he has also acquired a virtual air traffic controller degree. 
              He hopes to pursue his airline pilot dream after McGill, but until then, you will find him building drones for VFS and hosting fun nights with MSFC.
