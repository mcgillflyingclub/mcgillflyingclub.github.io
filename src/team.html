                Ali is a third-year student at McGill and is studying
                Bioengineering unfortunately. He is so passionate about aviation
                that he decided to go for his commercial pilot license. When
                he’s not flying around Montreal, you will usually find him
                behind a computer screen coding and solving geeky math problems.
                If that wasn’t enough of a headache on its own, Ali is also a
                teaching assistant for the Department of Mathematics &
                Statistics so that he can be submerged in new diverse complex
                problems every day all while helping others; the unknown is what
                gets him up in the morning. He also aspires to be a surgeon one
                day. So many dreams! As he used to say, “life is either a daring
                adventure or nothing at all”.
