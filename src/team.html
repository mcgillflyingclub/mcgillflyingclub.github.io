                that he decided to go for his commercial pilot license. When
                he’s not flying around Montreal, you will usually find him
                behind a computer screen coding and solving geeky math problems.
                If that wasn’t enough of a headache on its own, Ali is also a
                teaching assistant for the Department of Mathematics &
                Statistics so that he can be submerged in new diverse complex
                problems every day all while helping others; the unknown is what
                gets him up in the morning. He also aspires to be a surgeon one
                day. So many dreams! As he used to say, “life is either a daring
                adventure or nothing at all”.

                Arezki is a U3 Economics and Statistics student. His interest in

                airplanes. Coming into the role of VP Simulator, Arezki hopes to
                be able to inspire more McGill students to realize their
                passions for aviation. Besides that, Arezki enjoys playing
                soccer, watching basketball, and hanging out with friends.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Alex is currently managing Pilot for a Day events. Previously,
                he served as the fourth co-president along with Justin Berube.
                Alex studied electrical engineering at McGill. He grew up in the
                Kootenays of British Columbia where the mountains are what
                turned his head towards the sky. He has his Private Pilot's
                license as well as Glider instructors rating. When he’s not
                doing DPM or trying to figure out C++, you can find him scouting
                out the latest allyoucanfinish sushi restaurant. Interesting
                Fact: Every summer Alex has taught 15-17 year olds how to fly,
                they all have their license!

                Celine is currently a third year Management and Finance student

                planning on getting her PPL this year, making her dream come
                true. One fun fact about Celine: she still keeps in her room a
                Barbie airplane she received as a gift at the age of seven. In
                her free time, she loves to bake, exercise and work on her
                future social enterprise business plan.
