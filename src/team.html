          The McGill Students' Flying Club is always proud of its diverse team of aviation enthusiasts and pilots.

            <h3>Edward Cho</h3>
            <p>
              Edward is a U3 Occupational Therapy student whose love of flying stems from attending airshows 
              and first trying out Microsoft Flight Simulator almost two decades ago. Fast-forward to today, 
              he is a licensed private pilot and glider instructor, who spends his summers with the Royal 
              Canadian Air Cadet Program, teaching teenagers how to fly gliders! When he’s not in the air, 
              he’s probably either experimenting in the kitchen or looking for his new favorite sushi 
              restaurant. He also loves his dog.

            <h3>Sean Fernandes</h3>
            <p>
              Born and raised in Dubai, Sean fell in love with aviation through his experience growing up with 
              Microsoft Flight Simulator and flying often with Emirates. Eventually, Sean moved to England to 
              pursue a degree in Marketing, and his passion for aviation was highlighted when he worked on a 
              British Airways project to safely bring back customers during the uncertainty of the pandemic. He 
              decided to move to Canada and joined McGill to pursue Applied Marketing. Sean joined the MSFC to 
              help spread the word among McGill students, organize events, and bring more people into the amazing 
              world of aviation!

            <h3>Estelle Huy</h3>
            <p>
              Estelle is a U1 Mechanical Engineering Student. After completing her first commercial flight at age 
              six when her family moved to Canada from France, she was terrified at the idea of doing it again. 
              But with enough back and forth, fear turned passion and she passed her PPL before heading to McGill. 
              Perhaps to mock her previous fear, she now hopes to get into aerobatics. Aside from her studies and 
              passion for aviation, she can be found editing photos or on outside ventures.

            <p>
              Valentine is a U1 Mechanical engineering student from Strasbourg, France. She passed her private pilot 
              license during high school at the age of 17 years old. With a passion for aviation and aerospace, she 
              dreams of one day working in these exciting fields. When she’s not flying or studying, you’ll find her 
              recording episodes of her Le Trio podcast with her twin sister and brother, outside playing some kind 
              of sport, or designing and manufacturing a formula one car with the McGill Formula Electric club.

            <h3>Haoning Qu</h3>
            <p>
              Haoning is a U3 biology student in the middle of his instructor’s rating. What started out as a hobby 
              rapidly turned into a second career about midway through his private pilot’s license. Since then, he 
              has progressed along the traditional “pilot pipeline” collecting his commercial pilot’s license, group 
              3 instrument rating, and multi-engine rating. As the most experienced MSFC member, he aims to harness 
              the potential offered by this year’s fresh and incredibly diverse team to reinvigorate the MSFC, and 
              ensure that it continues to flourish in its second decade.

            <h3>Meiri Tsuruzono</h3>
            <p>
              Meiri is a U2 student majoring in Economics at McGill. She is the VP Events for the 2022-2023 year.
               Aviation was always an irreplaceable part of her life, and she hopes to take part in organising exciting 
               events for fellow aviation lovers this year! Besides aviation, her passions are travelling, playing the 
               violin, listening to jazz, and musical theatre.

            <h3>Lutming Wong</h3>
            <p>
              Lutming is a U1 student in computer engineering. He has been playing flight simulator since the age of 10, 
              and has had almost a decade of flight simulator experience. What inspired Lutming into flying was his father, 
              who works as an air traffic controller. He was brought to the airport and into the tower quite often to spot 
              planes when he was a little kid. Lutming hopes to start getting his pilot’s license in the not so far future; 
              aviation is his dream, and nothing can stop him from pursuing that dream.

            <h3>Yichen (Michael) Zhou</h3>
            <p>
              Michael is a pilot and one of the VP Events of the club. He is in his first year of Mechanical Engineering and 
              is planning to get a minor in aerospace. Since a young age he has fallen prey to the charms of mother nature – 
              both its breathtaking landscape and the mind-blowing scientific laws that shape the world; no magic brings them 
              together better than aviation. He started flying in the Prairies, receiving his PPL on the flatlands of 
              Saskatchewan. Fascinated by the theory of flight, he has decided that one day he will design his own big jets. 
              Outside of school, he is a big fan of natural documentaries, video games, association football, and math.
