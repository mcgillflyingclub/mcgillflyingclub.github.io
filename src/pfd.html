          <h2>Pilot For A Day</h2>
          <p>
            The "Pilot for a Day" event is an opportunity for aspiring pilots and curiosity aviation 
            enthusiasts to experience the excitement of general aviation. Taking a short flight with 
            our pilots and two other passengers means that the experience is much more cost effective 
            for you. 
          </p>
          <p>
            From there, some of our previous participants have gone on to taking their introductory 
            flight with a flight instructor, and most of them have proceeded onwards to pilot training. 
            Sometimes, the short trip in the passenger seat of a general aviation aircraft is all it 
            takes to light the spark of flight in you.

          <h3>Normal Event Timeline</h3>
          <p>
            The PFD event takes approximately 3 to 3.5 hours. This is the time between your departure 
            from the Roddick Gates to the time you arrive back at the Roddick Gates. The event is run 
            from Montreal/St. Hubert Longueuil Airport approximately 30 minutes drive from the Roddick 
            Gates. The entire flight lasts approximately 90 minutes, with a 30-minute briefing on the 
            ground with your pilot, and 60 minutes in the airplane itself. 
          </p>

          <h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3>
          <h5>What airplanes do you fly? Are they really safe?</h5>
          <p>
            We fly the Cessna 172 aircrafts for our events. The Cessna 172 is the most 
            produced training and general aviation aircraft in the world, known for it's 
            robust design and flexibility in operation. The airplanes we fly are very well 
            maintained, and must pass the stringent commercial operation standards set out 
            by Transport Canada. Any changes to the airplane as small as replacing a gauge 
            with an aftermarket one requires a complex set of documents. If your pilot believes 
            that there is a problem with the airplane, the flight will be cancelled.
          </p>
          <h5>Can we pick our seats?</h5>
          <p>
            We will always accomodate any seating requests ahead of time, but the seating 
            will always be assigned to ensure the safe distribution of weights for the flight.
          </p>
          <h5>Can I fly the airplane?</h5>
          <p>
            We will always accomodate the request to sit in the front beside the pilot as 
            much as possible. Should there be multiple participants wishing to sit in the 
            front, the seat will be allocated on a first come, first served basis as long 
            as the safety of the flight isn't affected. No previous piloting experience is 
            required to sit in the front, and we encourage those with previous experience to 
            prioritize the front seat for those without previous experiences.<br />
            Depending on the pilot of your flight, you will be seated on the left or the right 
            side of the airplane. Normally, you will receive the controls for approximately 5 
            minutes when the airplane is flying outside of the controlled airspace of Montreal. 
          </p>
          <h5>Can I fly if I have airsickness or other flying-related health conditions?</h5>
          <p>
            The full list of medical conditions that affect the safety of the flight is outlined 
            in the registration form. Not all flying-related conditions disqualifies you from flying 
            with us, but it is crucial that you disclose the conditions. Conditions that are permitted 
            for airline flying is not necessarily permitted in smaller aircrafts. Safety is always our 
            top priority, and we must opeate in a way that does not create undue hazard to our participants, 
            our pilots, or the equipment (aicrafts) we operate.
          </p>

            <h3>Cost</h3>
            <p>
              The typical PFD flight costs around $100/person including roundtrip transportation 
              between the Roddick Gates and the airport. However, the cost differs slightly depending 
              on the exact per-hour pricing of the aircraft and the exact flight time. Our pilots 
              volunteer their time, so the cost is purely to offset the expenses.
